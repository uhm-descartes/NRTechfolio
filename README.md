# Create your own NRTechfolio Repository

## Login to [GitHub](https://github.com)

You will need to [login](https://github.com/login) to GitHub or [create an account](https://github.com/signup). If you create an account, please remember that your username will be associated with all of your activities. You might want to keep it professional.

## Find the [NRTechfolio Template](https://github.com/uhm-descartes/NRTechfolio) Repository

Search for [uhm-descartes/NRTechfolio](https://github.com/uhm-descartes/NRTechfolio) or follow the provided [link](https://github.com/uhm-descartes/NRTechfolio).

## Use the Fork Luke!

DO NOT use the green "Use this template" button in the top left of the screen. Instead, press the "Fork" button three buttons over from end. Click that button and select "[+ Create a new fork](https://github.com/new?template_name=NRTechfolio&template_owner=uhm-descartes)" from the dropdown options.

## Create a New Repository

On the "Create a new repository" screen, fill in a name for your new repository in the middle of the page. It is suggested to use "NRTechfolio." Click the green "Create fork" button on the bottom right. Github will then create your new repository using the template and redirect you to the new repository when finished.

## Turn on Pages

* Go to [Settings/Pages](../../settings/pages) from your GitHub Repository, not the Codespace.
* Find the Branch section
* Choose the 'main' branch.
* Note the pages URL. It should be something like `https://awjans.github.io/NRTechfolio/`. This is the URL to your published NRTechfolio and the value will be needed when editing the Config YAML file later.

## Create a New Codespace

On the "<> Code" tab, find the green "<> Code" button. Click that button and select the "Codespaces" tab. Find and click the "Create codespace on main" button, and Github will create a codespace for you to edit your repository without downloading software to your computer. The codespace will be a website named something like "https://tangerine-parakeet-w47p5rppp725xgx.github.dev/", which you can bookmark for fast access later. The README.md file containing these instructions will be previewed so you can continue to follow along.
